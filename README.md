# Micro/Nano Plastic Detection via Paper Microfluidic Chips

Tldr: Predicted whether samples are classifiable as "Plastic" or "No Plastic" using various binary algorithms, analysing their respective classification accuracy against formulated hypothesis that samples containing plastics would have an F1 score of 0.80 or above.

Goal: Detection & Classification of MNP’s in Water
(Binary classification: “Plastic” vs “No Plastic”)

Hypothesis 1: Samples are classifiable as “Plastic” or “No Plastic” using various binary algorithms with an F1 score of 0.80 or above.

Hypothesis 2: Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and Aspartic Acid will be the two most important reagents for this classification across all algorithms.
